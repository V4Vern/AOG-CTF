# Polybius Message

Difficulty Level: Warmup

My Rival Agency recently discovered a new type of cipher and named it Polybius Message. It appears to be using some sort of grid system with all letters of the alphabet in order. This is one of the messages that I have retrieved “35 34 31 54 12 24 45 43 13 23 15 13 25 15 42 12 34 11 42 14 “ and I need your help to decode this message.

The flag format is in the form of 19C4{secret text}
