### Hints

- -	No hints are given.

## Deployment

Run  sudo ./build.sh in distrib to static file server.

## Solution

This is an attack on SQL Injection where A simple `' OR 1=1 -- -` injection will allow us to display us the contents of the entire table and get the flag.

### Flag
`19C4{pr3p4r3_70_u53_pr3p4r3d_57473m3n75}`
