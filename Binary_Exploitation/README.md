## Extra info

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.
If you are running the binary locally you do not need to run the bash script in `service`, just run the binary inside `distrib`:
- `generate` contains the source code for the binary
- `distrib` contains the files that were downloaded by the players
- `service` contains the files to run the service. 

Inside `service` you will find the following items:
- `bin` contains the flag and the binary to be run.
- `ctf.conf` is the xinetd configuration file.
- `Dockerfile` is the configuration file for Docker
- `<challenge_name>.sh` is the script which creates the docker container and restarts the container every 5 minutes.

If you have edited the binary in `generate` you will need to update `distrib` and replace the binary in `service/binary`. (This is extremely inefficient but I'm kinda lazy to change it lol)
