# Connect 

Difficulty Level: Warmup
 
Majority of the challenges ahead are hosted on a TCP server containing an exploitable input.
Before we start exploiting, let's practice connecting to the server.
Netcat is a network debugging tool which is great for testing the connection.
 
Connect via `nc challenge.ctf-fun.xyz 14000`
 
PS: Challenges in this category require a linux environment read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13RjL_RWibA9xYOKvSCXpTGG0D2ZYa3kDzprGNa8ypeA/edit?usp=sharing) for a guide to installing a linux VM

### Hints

- Use the `nc` command on linux

## Deployment

```bash
cd service
sudo ./connect.sh &
```

## Solution

For this challenge we just need to establish a connection to the server and receive input. This can be done in any way but netcat is a quick way to test out a connection.

```bash
nc challenge.ctf-fun.xyz 14000

Here is the flag:
19C4{netcat_is_easy}
