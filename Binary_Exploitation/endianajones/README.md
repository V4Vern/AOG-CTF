## Deployment

```bash
cd service
sudo ./endianajones.sh &
```

## Solution
Type in the buffer location from back to front

```bash
$ nc challenge.ctf-fun.xyz 14017
Give me the location of our buffer (0xffb4dc4f)
Type in the hex for each byte
Byte 1: 4f
Byte 2: dc
Byte 3: b4
Byte 4: ff
The buffer is at 0xffb4dc4f
You gave 0xffb4dc4f
You got it!
