# Messy	

Difficulty Level: Medium

I was playing with some hexadecimals when someone accidentally mixed junk data in my text file. Help me retrieve the flag! This is not a regular thing

### Hints

- Some people tell me that my expressions aren't really regular
- Regular Expression helps



## Deployment

Run ./generate/build.py to generate flag.txt

- ‚óè	flag.txt
    - SHA1: 5457b34323ed9012c6eb1b4eb1b9465f42c836b5
    - ASCII Text



## Solution

Use a regex to find the characters in the file that belong to base-16, afterwards decode it to get the flag.
